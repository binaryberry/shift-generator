# GOV.UK Admin Template

Styles, scripts and templates wrapped up in a gem for getting up and running with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based backend admin apps.

This gem provides (via a Rails engine):
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 3 standard styles and javascript — including HTML5 and respond.js shims necessary for IE <= IE8
* An admin layout with header and footer
* A [lightweight javascript framework](JAVASCRIPT.md)
* Admin design patterns available from `/style-guide` (when routes are mounted)
* [CSS helpers and SASS variables](CSS.md) for the admin theme
* GOV.UK user friendly date formats

[Apps using this gem](https://github.com/search?q=govuk_admin_template+path%3AGemfile&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=) include:
* [Transition](https://github.com/alphagov/transition)
* [Maslow](https://github.com/alphagov/maslow)
* [Support](https://github.com/alphagov/support)
* [Travel advice publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/travel-advice-publisher)
* [Specialist publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/specialist-publisher)
* [Search admin](https://github.com/alphagov/search-admin)

## Usage

Firstly, include the gem in your Gemfile, pinned to the appropriate version and run ```bundle```:
```ruby
gem 'govuk_admin_template', '1.0.0'
```

At the top of `application.scss` include the styles (this provides all the mixins and variables from the gem as well as from bootstrap — [bootstrap mixins](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss)):
```css
@import 'govuk_admin_template';
```

In `application.html.erb` after any content blocks you want to include, render the base template:
```erb
<%= render :template => 'layouts/govuk_admin_template' %>
```

The [base template](app/views/layouts/govuk_admin_template.html.erb) includes:
* Javascript and non-Javascript classes
* Mobile friendly viewport
* Bootstrap and jQuery javascript
* IE HTML5 and respondjs shims, and HTML classes
* header HTML
* footer HTML

You will also need to include your styles within the `<head>` of your HTML, do this using nested layouts:
```erb
<% content_for :head do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", :media => "all" %>
<% end %>
```

It is recommended that the style guide is also made available within your app at the route `/style-guide`. Add this to your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
mount GovukAdminTemplate::Engine, at: "/style-guide"
```

The gem source includes a [dummy app](spec/dummy) configured to behave like an app using the gem. If you have the gem checked out it can be run from the `spec\dummy` directory using `rails s`.

For Javascript usage, available modules and writing modules, see the [Javascript guide](JAVASCRIPT.md).

### Content blocks

The gem [uses nested layouts](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-nested-layouts) for customisation.

`content_for`     | Description
---------------   | -------------
`:app_title`      | Name of your admin application
`:content`        | Main content
`:head`           | HTML to include in the <head> of your application
`:page_title`     | Page title
`:navbar_items`   | A set of HTML list items (`<li>`) forming the primary navigation
`:navbar_right`   | Text to the right of the nav bar. Logged in user, sign out link, etc
`:footer_top` (optional) | Footer content before copyright text
`:footer_version` (optional) | Text indicating the release, eg commit SHA
`:body_end` (optional) | Just before the `</body>` tag

Example navbar_items:
```erb
<% content_for :navbar_items do %>
  <li>
    <a href="#">navbar_item</a>
  </li>
<% end %>
```

### Date formats

The [gem includes](lib/govuk_admin_template/engine.rb) date and time formats which match the [recommended style](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles/style-guide/style-points#style-dates-and-times).

```ruby
# 1 January 2013
date.to_s(:govuk_date)

# 1:15pm, 1 January 2013
time.to_s(:govuk_date)

# 1 Jan 2013
date.to_s(:govuk_date_short)

# 1:15pm, 1 Jan 2013
time.to_s(:govuk_date_short)

# 1:15pm
time.to_s(:govuk_time)
```

### Environment indicators

The gem includes default styles for development, preview and production. This includes a coloured environment label, a coloured strip beneath the main navigation and a coloured favicon. They are based on two variables that are set at deploy time (if they aren’t set no indicator will be shown).

The following should be set within an initializer:

```ruby
# used for the classname and favicon
GovukAdminTemplate.environment_style = [preview|production|development]

# used for the human readable label
GovukAdminTemplate.environment_label = [Preview|Staging|Production|Development]
```

## Development

Clone the repository and run `bundle`.

The source files are in the [app](app) directory. Unlike other GOVUK frontend gems, there is no compile step. The app directory is included in the gem and hooked in as a Rails engine.

While developing it may be helpful to see how the gem will render. The dummy app at [spec/dummy](spec/dummy) is configured to act like an application using the gem and can be started from that directory using `rails s`. Changes will show immediately. The tests also run against this app.

The dummy app’s rake tasks have been loaded into the gem’s task list under the namespace `dummy_app` for convenience.

### Running tests

The default rake task runs all tests:
```
bundle exec rake
```

Layout and nested layouts are tested using RSpec and Capybara:
```
bundle exec rake spec
```

Javascript is tested using Jasmine and the [Jasmine gem](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem). Tests can be run either in the browser or on the command line via the dummy app’s tasks:
```sh
# browser
bundle exec rake dummy_app:jasmine

# command line
bundle exec rake dummy_app:jasmine:ci
```

## Publishing

Version bumps will automatically update RubyGems.org.
